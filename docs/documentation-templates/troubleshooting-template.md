## Prevention

### Best Practices
1. **Always [action]** before [event]
   - Example: Always check port configuration before first run
   - Why: Prevents connection refused errors

2. **Configure [item]** in development
   - Example: Set up .env.local with correct values
   - Template: See configuration below

3. **Test with [method]** regularly
   - Example: Test in incognito mode
   - Catches: Authentication state issues

4. **Document [what]** for team
   - Example: Document actual ports in README
   - Prevents: Configuration mismatches

5. **Use [tool/process]** to validate
   - Example: Pre-commit hooks for config
   - Benefit: Catches issues before deployment

### Configuration Template
```javascript
// Recommended [config file name]
{
  "[setting1]": "[value1]",  // [Why this value]
  "[setting2]": "[value2]",  // [Important note]
  "[setting3]": {
    "[nested]": "[value]"    // [Configuration tip]
  }
}
```

### Validation Checklist
Before deployment, verify:
- [ ] [Configuration item 1] is set correctly
- [ ] [Service A] can connect to [Service B]
- [ ] [Security setting] is enabled
- [ ] [Performance setting] is optimized
- [ ] [Logs] are accessible
