## üöÄ Quick Quality Checks

### The 5-Minute Test
Can a new developer:
- [ ] Understand the problem/feature in 1 minute?
- [ ] Find the solution/implementation in 2 minutes?
- [ ] Start implementing/fixing in 5 minutes?

### The Search Test
Search for the primary keyword:
- [ ] Does this doc appear in results?
- [ ] Is it the most relevant result?
- [ ] Are search keywords comprehensive?

### The Freshness Test
- [ ] Versions mentioned are current?
- [ ] Code examples match current codebase?
- [ ] Links still work?
- [ ] Solutions still apply?

## ‚úÖ Final Approval

### Sign-off Checklist
- [ ] **Technical accuracy** - Implementation/fix works
- [ ] **Documentation standards** - Follows all templates
- [ ] **File organization** - In correct directory
- [ ] **Naming convention** - Follows standards
- [ ] **PROJECT-PROGRESS.md** - Updated with doc references

### Ready to Publish When

## üìù Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't Do This
- ‚ùå Document before implementation is stable
- ‚ùå Use absolute paths in examples
- ‚ùå Include environment-specific values
- ‚ùå Leave placeholder text
- ‚ùå Forget to update indices
- ‚ùå Use outdated screenshots
- ‚ùå Copy-paste without adapting
- ‚ùå Skip the verification steps

### Always Do This
- ‚úÖ Test every code example
- ‚úÖ Include actual error messages
- ‚úÖ Explain the "why" not just "how"
- ‚úÖ Consider multiple scenarios
- ‚úÖ Update when codebase changes
- ‚úÖ Think about future readers
- ‚úÖ Be honest about limitations
- ‚úÖ Provide escape hatches

## üéØ Documentation Goals

Remember, good documentation should:
1. **Save time** - Faster than figuring it out alone
2. **Prevent errors** - Stop mistakes before they happen
3. **Share knowledge** - Spread expertise across team
4. **Build confidence** - Developer knows they're on right track
5. **Enable independence** - Self-service problem solving
